# LTV, Liquidation

The Loan to Value (LTV) ratio defines the maximum amount of currency that can be borrowed with a specific collateral. Itâ€™s expressed in percentageS. E.g., at LTV=75%, for every 1 ETH worth of collateral, borrowers will be able to borrow 0.75 ETH worth of the corresponding currency. Once a loan is taken, the LTV evolves with market conditions.
