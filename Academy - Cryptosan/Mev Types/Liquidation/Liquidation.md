# Liquidation

As a type of MEV, liquidation is a process that occurs when a borrower's collateral value does not properly cover their loan/debt value.

In the event of a negative price fluctuation of the debt collateral (i.e., a move below the liquidation threshold), a position can be liquidated. In permissionless blockchains, anyone can repay the debt and claim the collateral.
