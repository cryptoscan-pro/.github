# Flipping

During hacks, CEX exchanges often freeze deposited funds for several days or months pending investigation. The purchased tokens may lose all their value.

### How does it work?  
You buy a coin and wait for the prices to converge to secure your profit.  

### **Pros of Flipping**:  
- **You won’t lose in a downturn** – In this case, you can quickly sell your assets.  
- **Minimal risks** – You don’t deposit funds, which means you avoid the risk of freezes or account blocks.  

### **Cons of Flipping**:  
- **Lower earnings** – Since prices converge, your profit margin will be smaller compared to arbitrage.
